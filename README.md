Using PostgreSQL over SQLite
PostgreSQL is the most advanced database management system and is one of the
most widely used in the world. It's free and open source, allows for much
more complexity and customizability over SQLite, and supports multi user
usability. While SQLite is more suitable for smaller single user programs like
mobile apps or games, PostgreSQL is more robust, flexible, and supports more
functionality.
